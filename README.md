    In crafting my portfolio, I enjoyed coding the pieces. Initially, I built the home page and explored bootstrap. Then, I progressed to the about and contact pages. Lastly, I tackled the work page due to its complexity.

    The main challenges I faced were with my offcanvas in my navigation and as for my work page the images and buttons to almost a minuite to load.

    To address these issues, I integrated the offcanvas into the navbar. I also resized images to enhance page loading speed.

    Through creating my web portfolio, I gained insights into coding, navigation refinement, and optimizing image loading for faster page performance.
